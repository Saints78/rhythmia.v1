        Rhytmia is a web application designed to create a playlist to workout to!
        Think of it like a scheduler. It <!--lets you make it however long it needs to be-->
        makes a 30 minute playlist, while taking into account the recommended times for warmups and cooldowns.

      <h1 id="questions">
        <q><i>How does it work?</i></q>
      </h1>
  
      <h2 id="answers">
       There were multiple ideas, but considering that this had to be made within a day,
       we opted to only look at your liked songs, and make a playlist based on your liked
       songs. More functionality to branch out to different artists in the genre would
       be added. An interactivity function was pitched to make it like a roguelike
       game to make your playlist, but that doesn't seem feasible to do within a day.
      </h2>
  
      <h1 id="questions">
        <q><i>Why even make this in the first place?</i></q>
      </h1>
  
      <h2 id="answers">
        Some people (myself included) don't really know what to play when to workout, or don't
        really feel bothered to make a playlist beforehand. Others (myself also included) have 
        a liked songs playlist or an amalgamation of songs, and tend to scroll through songs until 
        just the <u>right</u> song hits. This aims to help alleviate that problem.
  
        <h3>If none of the above applied to you (kudos to your dedication to making playlists!), I think
          it's good to know that there are studies backed up on the idea that playlists of a certain structure
          can improve performance.

        <q><i>Can you support what you're saying is true and not some marketing scheme?</i></q>

      <h2 id="answers">
        That's a good question! 
        <br><br>I get most places tend to say things and not found them upon research.
        Luckily, before even making this, I did some research beforehand to make sure there was some
        benefit from this. 
        <br><br>Music on a psychological basis provide motivation to workout.
        Warmups and cooldowns for exercises tend to last around 5 to 10 minutes each according to Harvard Health Publishing.
        Additionally, there are optimal BPMs for songs during warmups and cooldowns. According to "A Healthier Michigan",
        songs during warmups should start around 80 or 90 BPM and ramp up progressively to between 120 and 140 to signify 
        intense workout.
